        This is a simple example which demonstrates the capabilities of built-in calendar system. the 
        calendar allows the Gantt to skip non-working days during calculation of task durations.
        By default the only non-working time in calendar are weekends. Its possible to add the additional 
        holidays or exceptions (working day which is on weekend). 
        
        Holidays/exceptions should be represented as the `Gnt.model.CalendarDay` records in the calendar 
        store. Its also possible to apply custom styling for each holiday period.

    <p>Note that the js for the example code is not minified so it is readable.
