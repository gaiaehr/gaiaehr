A little bit of history of GaiaEHR:
At first we forked OpenEMR and then tried to adapt Sencha ExtJS to OpenEMR, Sencha ExtJS 
been a UI framework to speed up development of the project, but the time passed and we 
decided to make ourselves a community driven EHR where everyone can contribute and share 
ideas, well that’s how it got started, very simple motivation indeed. 

Launching our BETA release  is a big step forward to the medical industry innovation, 
taking the Open Source ideal as our guide.

Thanks very much to Matt Stack for creating the 
OpenEMR project and continuing to contribute to it over all these years.

Thanks to Synitech Corporation for taking OpenEMR this far.

Great thanks to Fred Trotter and the FreeB team, 
medical billing is never fun and Fred deserves a lot of credit for making our live easier!

Many thanks to Greg MacLelan for the number to text converter, 
sure glad we didn't have to code that from scratch!

This project has been greatly improved by incorporating 
elements of the following other projects:
